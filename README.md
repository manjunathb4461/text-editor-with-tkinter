# text-editor-with-tkinter
It is a text editor developed in python with gui using python's tkinter library

Our project considers creating a text editor using Graphical User Interface programming and Data Structures. So we have used python's tkinter a GUI library to create all of the GUI part of our project and at some parts we have used heap data structure. This text editor can create a new text file, open an already exitsting ones, edit the text file, find and highlight the searched words, find and replace the searched words, undo the users last action. The special feature of our editor is that as we go on typing the words and if we require a suggestion to complete the word, we can press suggest and editor suggests a list of words based on the words present in the dictionary.txt file and also adds all these words typed on to that dictionary file. It is a very easy to use Text Editor giving all the basic operations, and also a suggestion operation.
